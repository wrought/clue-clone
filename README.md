### Theories (Tools)

* Goëdel's Incompleteness Theroems
    * "[T]wo theorems of mathematical logic that establish inherent limitations of all but the most trivial axiomatic systems capable of doing arithmetic. [...] [W]idely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible, giving a negative answer to Hilbert's second problem."
    * Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems
* Unified Field Theory (i.e. gravity++)
    * "[A] type of field theory that allows all that is usually thought of as fundamental forces and elementary particles to be written in terms of a single field. [...] There may be no a priori reason why the correct description of nature has to be a unified field theory. However, this goal has led to a great deal of progress in modern theoretical physics and continues to motivate research."

* Conservation of Mass and Energy
    * "[A statement] that the total energy of an isolated system cannot change—it is said to be conserved over time. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but can change form, for instance chemical energy can be converted to kinetic energy in the explosion of a stick of dynamite."
    * Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy
    * "Mass and energy can be seen as two names (and two measurement units) for the same underlying, conserved physical quantity"

* Global Warming in the Anthropocene
    * "Global warming is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system."
    * Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming
    * "The Anthropocene is an informal geologic chronological term for the proposed epoch that began when human activities had a significant global impact on the Earth's ecosystems."
    * Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene
* Sub-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
    * "[P]rogress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems[:] [b]ottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or nouvelle AI, [...] [c]omputational intelligence [...] neural networks and "connectionism" [...] fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation"
    * Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Sub-symbolic
* Theory of Evolution
    * "[T]he change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organisation, including species, individual organisms and molecules such as DNA and proteins."
